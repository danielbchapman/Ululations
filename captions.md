Ululations and Gurgles of the Invisible

Welcome to The Mosesian Center for the Arts and Guerilla Opera’s showing of Ululations and Gurgles of the Invisible.

Before we begin, please take a moment to locate the nearest exits. There are two behind you at the top of the stairs and two from which you entered.

In the event of an emergency, please calmly exit and move away from the building.  

Please turn your devices off or to airplane mode with vibrations off, unless needed for accessibility.

There is also the possibility of pulsing or strobing lights and moments where the theater gets extremely dark.

Today’s performance is the final working dress rehearsal. We may stop the run at any time to work out any last minute technical aspects.

You might experience a true behind-the-scenes moment! 

Thank you and enjoy the final dress rehearsal of Ululations and Gurgles of the Invisible!

Chapter 2: Gurgles
The voice dances underwater


The little boy was looking for his voice.

The king of the crickets had it.

In a drop of water

the little boy was looking for his voice


(sounds: water droplets)
*trickle drop*

(sounds: gentle splashes)


(sounds: electronic music of chimes slowly fades in,
gently pulsing)

(motion sensor sounds:
gentle splashes and drops of water
surrounds)


(sounds: water bubbling, gentle excitement)


(piano music: sparkling high notes, one note at a time)

(simultaneous motion sensor sounds: *drip drop* into gurgling bubbles into gentle electronic whirls.)


I do not want it to speak with;

I will make a ring of it

so that he may wear my silence

on his little finger.

In a drop of water

the little boy was
looking for his voice.

The captive voice, far away,

put on a cricket’s clothes.

(“The Shadow's Theme”,
lyrical flowing piano melody)

In a drop of water
the little boy was looking for his voice.
The captive voice, far away,
put on a cricket’s clothes.


In a drop of water
the little boy was looking for his voice.
The captive voice, far away,
put on a cricket’s clothes.


(piano music: sparkling high notes, one note at a time)

(simultaneous electronic sounds: *drip drop* into gurgling bubbles and gentle electronic whirls.)

The shadow places its fingers on my back.

(soprano: pulsing fast high notes)

*Ahhhh*

Throw that ring into the water.

I am more than a hundred years old.

(soprano: fast notes into a high trill,
into throated pulsing high note)

*Ah ah ah aaaaaah*

Throw that ring. 

(piano: heavy chords
heavy chords and persistent trills)

(soprano: high note into throated pulsing high note)

*Ah ah aaaah*

Silence! Silence! Silence!
